# PythonII_FInal
Final Project for Python II 
I created a pet game that will alow the user to click on the screen and feed a pet
In the game there are two ways that the game can end,
First is by running out of health 
or by running out of happiness. 

I plan on adding more functionality to this game like a start screen
basic animations and more items to use to help keep the pet alive.
